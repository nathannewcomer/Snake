# Snake

This is the classic Snake game written in Python 3 using the pygame module. I started this in December 2017, but didn't actually
wite anything significant until December 2018. I started this project to show I know how to program in Python. 
The snake was made using a queue to hold the coordinates of each section. The front of the queue is the back of the snake,
so the head is the last coordinate of the queue. When the snake eats an apple, a new coordinate is added to the queue, thus putting it
at the end. I learned a lot about Python, but won't be writing any more games with it.
