# Snake

This is the classic Snake game written in Python 3 using the pygame module. I started this in December 2017, but didn't actually
wite anything significant until December 2018. I started this project to show I know how to program in Python.
I also used this project as a way to learn Visual Studio, but I can tell Visual Studio was not made to write Python games. 
The snake was made using a queue to hold the coordinates of each section. The front of the queue is the back of the snake,
so the head is the last coordinate of the queue. When the snake eats an apple, a new coordinate is added to the queue, thus putting it
at the end. I didn't particularly like writing this, since Python doesn't make you declare variable types and I had some trouble getting
tabs to cooperate with Visual Studio. Overall I learned a lot about Python, but won't be writing any more games with it.
